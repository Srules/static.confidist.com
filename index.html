        <h1>Confidist says Farewell</h1>
        <p>
            Confidist began in 2018 with the simple goal of promoting meaningful conversations. As the founder, my experiences with hundreds of you have been invaluable, and I will forever look back with pride and be grateful for the memories associated with running Confidist.
        </p>
        <p>
            Regrettably, Confidist has shut down as of May 2023 due to a couple of main factors. My recent journey into fatherhood requires my full attention, leaving me unable to dedicate the necessary time to improve the project. Additionally, I find it difficult to justify the platform's costs and maintain the servers as a personal expense. However, I remain committed to Confidist's vision and may consider reestablishing it at a later date.
        </p>

            <h2>Introducing: Around The Corner</h2>
            <p>
                I'm excited to share my new project with you! Around The Corner (ATC) is a unique social networking experience that brings strangers together over coffee through thoughtful, anonymous writing.
            </p>
            <p>
                ATC is all about creating genuine connections in our fast-paced world. We're taking things slow, focusing on quality over quantity, and bringing back the magic of face-to-face meetings. It's a place where you can be your true self without judgment, enjoy deeper conversations, and maybe even find a new friend.
            </p>
            <p>
                ATC is currently available in California, but we're eager to expand! If you're in CA, I'd be thrilled if you'd support this new adventure by signing up for free. Who knows? You might just brew up some serendipity!
            </p>
            <p>
                Not in California? No worries! We welcome you to join our waitlist. Your interest helps us tremendously in deciding where to expand next. By signing up for the waitlist, you're directly influencing ATC's growth and bringing it one step closer to your area.
